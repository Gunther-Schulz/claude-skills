Set the auto-skills classifier sensitivity level. $ARGUMENTS

Valid levels: low, normal, high

- low: Only trigger on explicit action keywords (evaluate, investigate, implement, fix, etc.)
- normal: Balanced — skips confirmations, discussions, git ops
- high: Trigger on anything plausible, only skip pure confirmations

Update CLASSIFIER_SENSITIVITY in ~/.config/claude-auto-skills/config.sh.
If the variable doesn't exist, append it. Use sed to update in place.

If no level is provided in arguments, show the current level and list the options.

After setting, report the new level.
